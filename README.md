# sparkjavatest

This is a demo project to test 2 things
- very simple setup of Sparkjava (http://sparkjava.com/) including setting a cachable response
- a usage of a caching http client (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/caching.html) which will honor the cache headers set in the server
